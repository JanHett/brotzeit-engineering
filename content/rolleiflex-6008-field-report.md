The Rolleiflex 6000 series is like an overachieving-but-socially-awkward brother to the Hasselblad 500 line of cameras: always a step ahead, but regularly pushed out of the spotlight by a mix of teething issues and marketing blunders.

But enough of the angsty comparisons: this is about how it feels to use Franke & Heidecke's electromechanical masterpieces in the field.

# Why I picked the Rolleiflex 6008

## TL;DR

* Lens selection: who can resist a leaf-shuttered 80 or 110mm f/2.0 or 180mm f/2.8?
* Rendering: especially the Schneider Kreuznach lenses for the system imbue a lovely bit of pastel magic to the photos taken with them
* Handling: I have a weak spot for a well thought-out camera with a wonderfully tactile user interface

## The long story

When I got started with medium format film photography, I had a Mamiya RB. I loved the giant matte screen - felt like I was watching a Christopher Nolan film every time I pointed its 127mm f/3.5 lens at a subject. Eventually I got tired of its hulk and also started itching for a camera with a built-in light meter.

I really wanted a Hasselblad 205: elegant, compact and adorned with the oh-so-desirable brand name. Alas, it was out of my budget.

Instead I came across the modern incarnation of the Rollei cameras: they looked like ugly plastic-fantastic toys to me, with their baby-blue-green buttons and weirdly knobby rubberized focus rings. However, The Internet claimed that their lens selection was beyond anything Hasselblad or even modern systems could offer and the price was indeed tempting (those were the days...).

I ended up with a Rolleiflex 6008 Professional along with an 80mm f/2.8 Xenotar. Long story short, I found its matte screen insufferably dim and the square format extremely odd and foolishly sold the lens a few years later with the intention of also getting rid of the body ASAP.

The body didn't find a buyer - instead, it sat on my shelf, taunting me and reminding me of the wonderfully pastel rendering of that Xenotar.

And taunt me it did, until one day I came across a mint 6008 Integral II with a set of lenses for a decent price and pounced. Fuelled by a better-paying job, I also got a whole slew of other lenses for the system as well: I wanted to sample that fabled ecosystem of glass now!

Armed with these new toys I found that a few more years had softened my heart towards the square format and the Integral II's bright matte screen certainly helped my appreciation for the beast as well.
