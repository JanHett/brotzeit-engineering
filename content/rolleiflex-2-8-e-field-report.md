I freely admit that I own more photography gear than I could ever need. The "classic" Rolleiflex is the one camera that has managed to make me forget about the nerdy little details and just concentrate on the experience. To me, it is The Camera. It's light enough to travel with, it's a fabulous conversation starter and pressing the shutter somehow feels cathartic every time.

I don't have much of an origin story for how I got to own my Rolleiflex 2,8 E. I came into the world of film photography, I saw those odd, two-eyed pieces of jewellery and fell more and more in love with the idea of using them until one fine day I snapped one up.

I won't go into too much detail about the various models either: [a gentleman named Colton Allen has typed up a first rate introduction to the series I can wholeheartedly recommend](https://www.filmshooterscollective.com/analog-film-photography-blog/rolleiflex-buying-guide-1-11).

If you're interested in the more modern (but nevertheless marvellous) Rolleiflex 6000 series, I also have [an article](./rolleiflex-6008-field-report) on those.

Instead, I want to discuss what it's like to use one of these overengineered pieces of art[^1].

# Shooting the Rolleiflex 2,8 E

> **Note:** My Rolleiflex is a 2,8 E with a Zeiss Planar taking lens. For the most part these observations should be transferrable to other models like the 2,8 C, D or F, or even the 3,5 series, though.
