## Method

Mix everything together and knead until perfectly homogeneous. If the dough is sticky, add more flour. If it is too dry, balance with a few drops of water or olive oil. Wrap tightly in cling film and let rest in the fridge for at least an hour.

On a lightly flouered working surface, roll into 1mm thick sheets and cover until needed.

## Method

### Slow-roasted beef

This method assumes a tougher cut of beef.

Mix the mustard and olive oil with enough salt, pepper and paprika poweder to thoroughly season the meat. Slather the meat in the mixture and let rest in the fridge for at least one day.

Place the meat in a baking tray, cover tightly and place in an oven that has been pre-heated to 120ºC. Remove when the meat starts to fall apart.

### Sauce [^1]

While the beef is cooking, dice the pancetta, onions, carrots and celery and cut the mushrooms into medium-sized chunks. Fry the ham at high heat, then add the vegetables and the olive oil to the pot. Once the onions are starting to take on some colour, crush the garlic cloves and introduce them into the mix shortly before dousing with the white wine and the crushed tomatoes.

Shortly before the ragù is finished cooking, shred the beef and add it as well as its juices to the pot. Reduce and season to taste.

# Assembly

## Ingredients

The previously prepared...
